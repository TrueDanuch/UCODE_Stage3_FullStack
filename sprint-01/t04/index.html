                    A communication protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications
                    system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. The protocol
                    defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error
                    recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both. <br>

                HTTP <br> <br>
                    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed,
                    collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for
                    the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user
                    can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.<br>
                    Development of HTTP was initiated by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989. Development of early HTTP
                    Requests for Comments (RFCs) was a coordinated effort by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
                    and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), with work later moving to the IETF.<br>

                HTTPS <br> <br>
                    Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                    (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the
                    Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security
                    (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The protocol is therefore also referred to as HTTP
                    over TLS, or HTTP over SSL.<br>
                    The principal motivations for HTTPS are authentication of the accessed website, and protection of
                    the privacy and integrity of the exchanged data while in transit. It protects against
                    man-in-the-middle attacks, and the bidirectional encryption of communications between a client and
                    server protects the communications against eavesdropping and tampering. The authentication
                    aspect of HTTPS requires a trusted third party to sign server-side digital certificates. This was
                    historically an expensive operation, which meant fully authenticated HTTPS connections were usually
                    found only on secured payment transaction services and other secured corporate information systems
                    on the World Wide Web. In 2016, a campaign by the Electronic Frontier Foundation with the support of
                    web browser developers led to the protocol becoming more prevalent. HTTPS is now used more often
                    by web users than the original non-secure HTTP, primarily to protect page authenticity on all types
                    of websites; secure accounts; and to keep user communications, identity, and web browsing
                    private.<br>

                DNS<br> <br>       
                    The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online
                    through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol
                    (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

                    Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the
                    device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in
                    IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in
                    IPv6).<br>

                IP<br>                
                    An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP
                    stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the
                    internet or local network. <br>
                    In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a
                    network: they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The
                    internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP
                    addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works. <br>
                    To find ip of site we need: <br>
                    1. Open console <br>
                    2. ping site <br>
                    For example: <br>
                    google.com - 172.217.18.78 <br>
                    google.com.ua - 172.217.20.3 <br>
                    ucode.world - 207.154.232.87
