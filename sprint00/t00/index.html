        <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
        <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person 
            couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal 
            human being could possess,</b> and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman 
            or a fireman could be considered a superhero. For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a 
            regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower 
            who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a normal 
            human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

        <p>Thor</p>
        <p>Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder, 
            the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, and a 
            founding member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible 
            and impetuous behavior reignited a conflict between 
            Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to 
            become king, stripped of his power, and banished to 
            Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned 
            humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and helped 
            save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. 
            Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed 
            himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, 
            which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.</p>
