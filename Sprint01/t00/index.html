        All the power of the storm, from all the world, flows through my veins, and can be summoned by mine hammer at
        any time, wherever it is.
        A lightning storm in Japan? Mine. A hurricane off the coast of Barbados? Mine again. A brace of tornadoes in
        Kansas? Aye... mine.
        All that might, all that destructive force, mine to command. Channeled and guided through the mystic might of
        this hammer, guided right at thee!

        Thor is the blood-son of Odin, All-Father of the Asgardians, and Firehair, an ancient avatar of the Phoenix
        Force.
        In order to ensure that Thor would dedicate himself to protecting the Earth, Odin lied to his son for milennia
        that his birth-morther was Jord,
        who was also known as Gaea, the goddess who was one of the Elder Gods. Odin claimed that he sought to father a
        son whose power would
        derive from both Asgard and Midgard (as the Earth realm is called by Asgardians), and hence he sought to mate
        with Jord.
        Odin created a cave in Norway where Jord gave birth to Thor. Months after the infant Thor was weaned, Odin
        brought him to Asgard
        to be raised. Odin's wife, the goddess Frigga, acted as Thor's mother from that time onward. Not until many
        decades later did Thor
        learn the purported truth that Jord was his birth mother, though the Phoenix revealed that Odin had lied about
        Thor's
        parentage and that it was his birth mother through Firehair.

        The Ragnarok cycle created numerous versions of Thor's origin story, and the fact that Asgard was a place of
        myth did not help
        matters when trying to keep track of all of the different stories and personalized descriptions of events. One
        such story came
        from the severed eye of Odin, which grew to great size, achieved sentience, and told Thor of another Thor who
        had existed before
        the current Thor's birth. This previous Thor was also the son of Odin but had red hair, not blond hair like the
        current Thor.
        Thor was said in myth to have killed the Midgard Serpent, and to have been killed himself by the dying monster's
        venom, at Ragnarok,
        the destruction of a previous version of Asgard. Odin himself was killed, but a new Odin appeared in the place
        of several gods
        who survived Ragnarok, and it was this new Odin who fathered the current version of Thor. It is uncertain
        whether a true
        picture of Thor's origin will ever be told.
